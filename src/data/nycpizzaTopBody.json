            "paragraph": "Texture in wine comes from its tannins (it's what makes your mouth feel dry after a sip) and the acidity. A great wine has both of those components in balance. Orange and red wine, which have tannins from skin contact during fermentation, would work well. Alternatively, something with effervescence (bubbles!) could also have a similar effect."
